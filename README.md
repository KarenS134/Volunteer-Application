## Installation

2. Run file HelloApplication.java

## Inspirations

Took some inspiration of the how the GUI of the buttons from belmont look like and how the cards in balboa's webpage looked like. I wanted to show a bit
more of the color palatte from balboa's webpage since both my webpage and balboa is about parks and nature which the coloring of the webpage can give a more
outdoors/nature experience.

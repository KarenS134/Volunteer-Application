# Volunteer Application

Made a webpage to find a wolunteer application to make it so that the experience for the user is similar to when visiting a normal web site.
In this webpage you are able to interact with this webpage in order to get to you desired Volunteer Application, in which helps guide you towards submitting an application.

## Installation

1. clone repository
2. Run file HelloApplication.java

## Inspirations

Took some inspiration of the how the GUI of the buttons from belmont look like and how the cards in balboa's webpage looked like. I wanted to show a bit
more of the color palatte from balboa's webpage since both my webpage and balboa is about parks and nature which the coloring of the webpage can give a more
outdoors/nature experience.
